# VPN Client

When you want to connect to the PropertyGuru Singapore or Thailand office over VPN from home or somewhere else.

Please add both the Singapore and Thailand config files, even if you intend to connect to only one, as in case the VPN in one offices is down then it will be possible to use the other office as a fallback.

Delete the zip file and the email after confirming the VPN connection works. The `.ovpn` files contain a secret which should not leave the device where it's being used. Also don't backup the `.ovpn` files. In case the file is lost because of reinstall, hardware failure or replacement, ask for a new VPN certificate. Do not copy the certificate to another device, ask for a separate certificate for each device. In case the device is stolen or lost, or the VPN is not being used any more, inform systems@propertyguru.com.sg to revoke the certificate.

## Windows
1. Install OpenVPN from <https://openvpn.net/community-downloads/>.
Choose `Windows installer (NSIS)`.  
During the installation accept the default options, we don't need more than that, and less than that will probably not work.  
2. Start the OpenVPN GUI, the icon was added to your desktop ![OpenVPN icon](icon-3.png)
3. If this is your first time using OpenVPN, then the GUI will complain that "No readable connection profiles (config files) found. This is normal.
4. Now you need to tell OpenVPN to use the `propertyguru-vpn-singapore.ovpn` and `propertyguru-vpn-thailand.ovpn` config files you received. There are 2 ways to do this:
   * Copy the `.ovpn` files from the zip file to the `%userprofile%\OpenVPN\config` folder.
   * Right click on the OpenVPN tray icon, choose "Import file..." and select the `.ovpn` file from the zip
file:  
![OpenVPN Import file...](OpenVPN%20Import%20file....png)
5. Now when you right click on the OpenVPN tray icon, you will see a "Connect" item too:  
![OpenVPN Connect](OpenVPN%20Connect.png)
6. If you have any issues connecting, then choose `View Log` from the menu and send the whole log to your friendly IT support.

## Ubuntu with NetworkManager
We are detailing the steps for Ubuntu, as that's the most common OS, and with NetworkManager because that's the most convenient way of doing it. It's also possible to set up the connection without NetworkManager, but then you will have to stop/start the vpn from the command line and you will have no GUI indication if the VPN is running or not.

This needs at least Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Bionic. The NetworkManager version in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS Xenial is too old and doesn't support the features we need.

1. Install the `network-manager-openvpn-gnome` package with your favourite package manager.
2. Click the NetworkManager tray icon and choose `Edit Connections...`  
  ![NetworkManager Edit Connections...](NetworkManager%20Edit%20Connections....png) |
3. Choose `Import a saved VPN configuration...` as the connection type  
![NetworkManager Connection Type](NetworkManager%20Connection%20Type.png) |
4. Choose the `propertyguru-vpn-singapore.ovpn` file which you extracted from the zip file in the email.
5. On the `IPv4 Settings` tab choose `Routes...` and make sure the `Use this connection only for resources on its network` is checked. By default it's unchecked and then NetworkManager adds a default route over the VPN which means all your internet traffic will go over the VPN. This is probably not what you want. When it's checked, then only the traffic which actually needs VPN will be routed over to the office network.  
  ![NetworkManager IPv4 Routes](NetworkManager%20IPv4%20Routes.png)
6. On the `General` tab uncheck  
- [ ] All users may connect to this network
7. Optional: NetworkManager 1.10.6 from Ubuntu Bionic does not support the `compress`, and ignores it. This is a problem because then the `push "compress lzo"` command from the server will also be ignored and the connection will fail. To work around this go to the `VPN` tab, click `Advanced...` and check:  
- [x] Use LZO data compression `adaptive`  
The downside is that if we change the compression on the server, that will not match the hardcoded value on the client any more, and the connection will fail. <!--- Check if it's fixed in the next Ubuntu release. -->
8. `Save` the new VPN connection  
![NetworkManager Save](NetworkManager%20Save%20Button.png)
9. Repeat the above steps for the `propertyguru-vpn-thailand.ovpn` file.

## MacOS
There are 2 ways to do it on MacOS. One is the GUI way, with Tunnelblick, and the other is to `brew install openvpn` and run it on the command line.

### Mac OS with Tunnelblick GUI
Follow openvpn protocol guide to setup VPN on macos as follows: <http://www.vpngate.net/en/howto_openvpn.aspx#mac>

Tunnelblick will show a warning:
<blockquote>
  This computer's apparent public IP address was not different after connecting to propertyguru-vpn-singapore. It is still W.X.Y.Z.
  
  This may mean that your VPN is not configured correctly.
</blockquote>
This is because we don't route everything over the VPN, only the traffic which goes to our internal network, and some public IPs, which have source IP rules. So just select `Do not warn about this again for any configuration` and press `OK`.

### MacOS with OpenVPN CLI
1. Save the configuration file to `~`. Make sure it is readable only for your user since it contains private key.
2. Install OpenVPN ```brew install openvpn```
3. Start the VPN connection ```sudo openvpn --config ~/propertyguru-vpn-singapore.ovpn``` (or use `propertyguru-vpn-thailand.ovpn`)
    
## Android
1. Install the [OpenVPN Connect app from the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.openvpn.openvpn)
2. TODO
3. Profit!

## iOS
TODO

Because apple store doesn't allow GPL the OpenVPN app doesn't have compression support. That means the VPN connection to the server will be successful, but no traffic can get through and the server log has a lot of `Bad LZO decompression header byte: 251`. This was worked around in the Thailand office by switching off compression for clients which don't support it. But the OpenVPN server version in Singapore is too old to be able to do it. The result is that currently it's not possible to connect to the Singapore VPN with iOS. But it's possible to connect to the Thailand VPN.
